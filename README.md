# Overview

This is an attempt to prove (in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)) the
semantic subtyping relation found in this paper:

   * **Sound and Complete Flow Typing with Unions, Intersections and
     Negations**, David J. Pearce.  In _Proceedings of the Conference
     on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation_
     (VMCAI), pages
     335--354, 2013. [[PDF]](https://whileydave.com/publications/Pea13_VMCAI_preprint.pdf)
     
This is mostly an exercise in learning Coq, so we'll see whether or
not it gets finished.
